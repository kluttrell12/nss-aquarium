                  <p class="maintenenceParagraph">Aquarium Water Changes. Scheduled aquarium maintenance would not be complete without the water change. We recommend an average water change of 10 – 15%, every two weeks.
                    Testing the Aquarium Water. Because we can’t determine water quality by looking at it, it is very important to do regular testing.
                    Filter Maintenance. The aquarium filter should be serviced monthly. A densely stocked aquarium may require more frequent filter cleanings.
                    Recommended Aquarium Maintenance Routine. Make sure the equipment is running properly. Watch your fish during feeding. Behavioral changes are a good indicator of a potential problem.
                    In Conclusion. Every aquarium is different and will require a maintenance schedule that is best suited for its unique conditions.
